## Getting started
Node.js is required to run and install the slides. Go to the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest version and install it on you machine.

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the Integrated Development Environmen (IDE) for this course.

Check that everything is installed correctly by running the following commands in a terminal `node -v` and `npm -v`. (If you get some output, everything should be all good)

## Slides
The slides in this course is built with [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) that is a HTML presentation framework. 

When running the slides for the first time, you will need to download the dependencies using the Node package manager (npm). Run `npm install` in the terminal in the `./slides` directory.

Run the slides by typing `npm start` and open a browser and go to [http://0.0.0.0:8000](http://0.0.0.0:8000).
